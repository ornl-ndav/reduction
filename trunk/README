Installation Instructions
=========================

1) The SNS Common Libraries uses Swig for generation of Python bindings to 
   the library functions. This program must be accessable on the compilation 
   machine. Doxygen is used for creating documentation. If documentation is 
   desired and did not come with the distribution, this program must be 
   accessable on the compilation machine.

2) At present it is necessary to run the autogen shell script to produce the 
   correct configure file.

   sh autogen.sh

3) Run 'configure' and 'make'. The build system needs to know where the
   python directories (include, lib, etc.) live. This is usually /usr, but 
   could be elsewhere. Therefore, the --with-python switch must be used.

   ./configure --with-python=/pythonhead
   ./make
   
   If there are any problems, try different configure options to see if one 
   will work.  You can see what switches are available by typing
   
   ./configure --help

4) Install the files in the default location (usually /usr/local) using

   make install

5) Test the installation using 

   make test

6) To make documentation

   make docs
