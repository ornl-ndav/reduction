Installation Instructions
=========================

Prerequisites

   The SNS Common Libraries uses Swig for generation of Python bindings to 
   the library functions. This program must be accessable on the compilation 
   machine. Doxygen is used for creating documentation. If documentation is 
   desired and did not come with the distribution, this program must be 
   accessable on the compilation machine.

1) Extract the archive

   tar xzf sns_common_lib-<version>.tar.gz
   cd sns_common_lib-<version>

2) Run 'configure' and 'make'. 

   ./configure
   make

   If your Python directories (include, lib, etc.) do not reside in the usual 
   locations (/usr or /usr/local), you need to use the --with-python switch to 
   tell the build system where the main Python directory is. So, run 
   'configure' as follows and then run 'make' as usual.

   ./configure --with-python=/pythonmain
   make
   
   If there are any problems, try different configure options to see if one 
   will work.  You can see what switches are available by typing
   
   ./configure --help

3) Test the installation using 

   make test

4) Install the files in the default location (usually /usr/local) using

   make install
