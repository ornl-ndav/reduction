Unless you plan to build the rpm files as root you will need to do the
following:

(1) Create a   ~/.rpmmacros   file with a line similar to the following

%_topdir	/home/2zr/mybuilds

(note: that is a tab separating the two parts)

(2) create the corresponding RPM build directories

    cd /home/2zr/mybuilds
    mkdir BUILD RPMS SOURCES SPECS SRPMS
    cd RPMS
    mkdir i386 i486 i586 i686

(i.e. this should look like the default build area /usr/src/redhat)

(3) Now you should be able to run the  build_rpm  script - this
    will generate src and binary rpms from the current 
    nexus*.tar.gz created from the last "make distcheck" or "make dist"

(4) The above will generate both a src and binary (probably i386) rpm
    You can always generate a binary rpm from a source rpm using e.g.

        rpmbuild --rebuild sns_common_libs-2.0.0-1.src.rpm

    While re-building files will be copied to a
    temporary installation directory structure under /tmp/sns_common_libs-2.0.0
    You may change this location using the  --buildroot  option, but
    be very careful as the "build root" may ultimately get removed by rpm.
    In particular, DO NOT give "/" as the build root.

    If you want the final files installed in a different directory to
    the defaults (/usr/local/{bin,lib,sns_common_libs}), get/build the binary 
    rpm and then use the  rpm --prefix  installation option e.g.

        rpm -ivh --prefix /opt sns_common_libs-2.0.0-1.i386.rpm

    will install the files to /opt/{bin,lib,sns_common_libs}
