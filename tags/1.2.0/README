Installation Instructions
=========================

Prerequisites

   The SNS Common Libraries uses Swig for generation of Python bindings to
   the library functions. This program must be accessable on the compilation
   machine. Doxygen is used for creating documentation. If documentation is
   desired and did not come with the distribution, this program must be
   accessable on the compilation machine. The minimum software versions for 
   dependencies are listed below.

     1. GCC            - 3.4.6
     2. Autoconf       - 2.59
     3. Automake       - 1.9.4
     4. Libtool        - 1.5.10
     5. Swig           - 1.3.28
     6. Python         - 2.3.4
     7. Doxygen        - 1.4.6
     8. Dot (Graphviz) - 2.8

   Note: Higher versions may work but are not guaranteed. 

1) Extract the archive

   tar xzf sns_common_lib-<version>.tar.gz
   cd sns_common_lib-<version>

2) Run 'configure' and 'make'.

   ./configure
   make

   If an alternate Python distribution is needed, make sure the Python command
   appears in the $PATH first. That one will be interpreted and used by the 
   configuration system.  

   If there are any problems, try different configure options to see if one
   will work.  You can see what switches are available by typing

   ./configure --help

3) Test the installation using

   make test

4) Install the files in the default location (usually /usr/local) using

   make install
